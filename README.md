## Course Overview

ECE393 is an upper-level, lab-intensive design course that builds upon the foundation of **analog electronics and circuit analysis** introduced in earlier courses. It focuses on developing the ability to design, implement, and characterize complete analog systems while reinforcing theoretical concepts through practical experimentation.

Students progress from analyzing individual amplifier stages to **integrating multiple subcircuits** into functional analog systems such as oscillators, active filters, and feedback amplifiers. The course emphasizes iterative design, bias optimization, gain stabilization, and feedback theory, combining analytical problem-solving with simulation and hardware verification.

Key learning experiences include:

* **Practical Circuit Design** – Applying biasing, small-signal models, and frequency response analysis to create working circuits.
* **Simulation and Verification** – Using CAD tools such as **LTspice**, **Cadence Virtuoso**, and **Spectre** to verify theoretical predictions and tune real-world performance.
* **Team-Based Collaboration** – Working in design teams to troubleshoot, document, and present circuit results with engineering precision.
* **Professional Communication** – Writing detailed lab-style documentation and giving technical presentations to communicate design intent and results clearly.

By the end of this course, students gain confidence in taking a circuit from concept to working prototype, validating design goals through both simulation and experiment.

## Learning Objectives

* Design, simulate, and analyze analog electronic subsystems such as **amplifiers, oscillators, and active filters** using BJTs and MOSFETs.
* Apply **Barkhausen criteria**, feedback theory, and small-signal analysis to achieve stable and sustained oscillations.
* Evaluate and interpret **gain, phase, bandwidth, and distortion** in both simulated and experimental environments.
* Balance design trade-offs between **power consumption, frequency response, and linearity** for robust circuit operation.
* Use **CAD tools** to simulate, validate, and refine analog designs prior to implementation.
* Collaborate effectively in engineering teams to complete design projects, reports, and presentations.
* Develop technical writing and communication skills for professional reporting and documentation.

## Projects

### [Project 1: RC Phase-Shift Oscillator](./Project%201%20-%20RC%20Phase%20Shift%20Oscillator/ "Read More")

A single-transistor BJT **common-emitter** oscillator using a three-stage RC ladder network. The design demonstrates the **Barkhausen criteria** and phase-shift feedback required for sustained sinusoidal oscillation.
